			<p>I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I love what I do. I love solving problems, creating things, and making people smile. Currently I am working as a digital art director for <a href="http://www.integer.com">Integer</a> in Des Moines, Iowa. I work with clients ranging from <a href="http://www.michelinman.com/">Michelin</a> to <a href="http://www.carpetone.com/">Carpet One</a> to <a href="http://www.diamondnuts.com/">Diamond Nuts</a> creating print, as well as digital solutions.</p>
			
			<p>My life is all about design. I love to solve problems in a beautiful, elegant way. I love to learn new things and am constantly searching for the next challenge. I am frequently posting on my <a href="http://brianjhanson.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, mixing pixels for <a href="http://dribbble.com/brianjhanson">Dribbble</a>, or sharing myriad thoughts on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brianjhanson">Twitter</a>.
			<p>I am currently accepting client projects. If you'd like to work with me please drop me a line at <a href="mailto:brian@brianhanson.net">brian (at) brianhanson.net</a>.</p>
